# Backhand

1. As soon as you see the ball, develop a __lateral__ step, as if I show my back towards the opponent. Make sure the step is large enough so that the base remains strong. Also, sit a little bit, as this will generate more power. While all this happens, turn the racket by 120 degrees, located at the top.

2. Rotate the racket and hit the ball, as your body rises, the weight is transferred towards the right food, and then your body turns towards the front.

3. Stretch the left arm towards the back. Stretch the front arm towards the top right.
