# Slice Serve

Remeber these key points:



1. __Bend the knees!__ But there is no need to collect your feet. 

2. Toss the ball __slightly__ towards the __right__, but still quite in front, so that the opponent does not notice it. 

3. When you toss the ball, your right shoulder must face against the court, and after you hit the ball, your right shoulder must face towards the court. In other words, during the process of hitting, my body should turn 180 degrees. The right shoulder should move towards the ball. Don't try to move the entire arm; __focus on the right shoulder.__

4. __Bend the knees!__ But there is absolutely no need to collect your feet. 

5. Hit the __front, northeastern__ part of the ball.
