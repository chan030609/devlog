# Forehand

1. Starting position. Use the semi-western grip (4). Bend the wrist a little less than 90 degrees perpendicular to the arm. 

2. As soon as you see the ball coming, turn the body completely towards the right, and place the racket towards the back of the court (turn less than 180 degrees), arriving at the power position. In this position, it's good to have some space between your body and the racket. Do NOT care about the so-called under-table position.

3. Uncoil it! Remember, the racket must lag behind your shoulder. The shoulder must go first, and then the arm, then the wrist, and finally, the head of the racket, lagging behind all the other body components.

4. Don't stop the motion after you hit the ball. Allow your arm to arrive at its natural position, without arbitrarily controlling its motion.
